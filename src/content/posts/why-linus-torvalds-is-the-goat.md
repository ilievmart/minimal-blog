Linus Torvalds is a Finnish software engineer who created the Linux kernel and Git VCS. Software development would be way different if it wasn't for his genius ideas that have become industry standards. That's why he's the GOAT.

"A computer is like air conditioning – it becomes useless when you open Windows." - Linus Torvalds
